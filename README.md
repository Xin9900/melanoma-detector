# 🧪 Melanoma Detector (Demo)

This is a lightweight Streamlit web demo that simulates melanoma classification from skin lesion images.  
It is part of my personal exploration into **AI-assisted diagnostics for early skin cancer detection**.

---

## ✨ Features

- Upload a skin lesion image (JPG/PNG)
- Simulated prediction result: **Benign** or **Malignant**
- Built with: `Python`, `Streamlit`, `Pillow`

---

## 🛠️ How to Run Locally


```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```
---

## ⚠️ Note

This prototype currently uses **mock results** for demonstration purposes.  
A trained deep learning model will be integrated in future versions (ResNet34 on ISIC2018).

---

## 🔭 Future Plans

- Integrate a real CNN model trained on ISIC 2018 dataset  
- Add Grad-CAM heatmap for interpretability  
- Explore multi-modal integration (image + metadata)  
- Build lightweight web-based health tools for underserved communities

---

## 💡 Motivation

This project was inspired by my interest in **AI for accessible healthcare**.  
It represents my early effort to prototype intelligent tools that lower the barrier to early screening.

Based on this, I plan to further explore:

- Drug response prediction using multi-omics data  
- Variant effect modeling for rare genetic diseases
